<h1>HTML</h1>

     is the standard 
    markup language for <strong>creating 
    <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
     from local storage and render them into multimedia 
     web pages. HTML describes the structure of a 
     web page semantically and originally included cues
      for the appearance of the document.

    With HTML constructs, images and other objects, s
    uch as interactive forms, may be embedded 
    into the rendered page. It provides a mean
    s to create structured documents by denoti
    ng structural semantics for text such as he
    adings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
     other items. HTML elements are delineated by t
     ags, written using angle brackets.
